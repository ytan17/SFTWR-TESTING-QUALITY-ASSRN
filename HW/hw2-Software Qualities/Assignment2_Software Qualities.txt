Assignment 2: Software Qualities
1)
Calculation version1:

For the original case: 
		System goes down -- 2 times per week
		down time        -- 3 minutes each time

plan A: half the down time per week && MTTF remains the same
		(1 week) system goes down -- about 2 times
		(1 term) down time        -- average 1.5 minutes

	=	(2 weeks) system goes down -- about 4 times
		(1 term)  down time        -- average 1.5 minutes

	= 	(in 2 weeks) system goes down about 4 time which is about 6 minutes in total
	= 	(in 4 weeks) system goes down about 8 time which is about 12 minutes in total
	= 	(in 8 weeks) system goes down about 16 time which is about 24 minutes in total

Plan B: doubling MTTF && availability remains the same
		(2 weeks) system goes down -- about 2 times
		(1 term)  down time        -- average 3 minutes

	= 	(in 2 weeks) system goes down about 2 time which is about 6 minutes in total
	= 	(in 4 weeks) system goes down about 4 time which is about 12 minutes in total
	= 	(in 8 weeks) system goes down about 8 time which is about 24 minutes in total


Calculation version2:
For the original case:
	availability  = (1 week - 2 times * 3 minutes)/1 week = (10080 minutes - 6 minutes)/ 10080 minutes = 99.94%
	MTTF = (1 week - 2 times * 3 minutes)/ 2 times = 10074 minutes / 2 times = 5037 minutes

Plan A:
	availability  = (1 week - 2 times * 1.5 minutes)/1 week = (10080 minutes - 3 minutes)/ 10080 minutes = 99.97%
	MTTF = (1 week - 2 times * 1.5 minutes)/ 2 times = 10077 minutes / 2 times = 5038.5 minutes

Plan B:
	availability  = (1 week - 2 times * 3 minutes)/1 week = (10080 minutes - 6 minutes)/ 10080 minutes = 99.94%
	MTTF = (1 week - 1 times * 3 minutes)/ 1 times = 10077 minutes / 1 times = 10077 minutes

Based on the calculation above, I would like to make an improvement follow Plan B. 
1.
(version1) By using plan B, after 2 weeks' running, the system would have less chance to go down, and plan A and plan B take about the same time for system goes up in total by weeks. 
(Version2) By using plan B, the availability goes down about 0.03% than using plan A. However, the MTTF of plan B is about double size of MTTF of plan A which mean the system will have lower chance to go down by using plan B.
2. Therefore, by using plan B, there would be a lower chance for about the maximum of 150 users to experience the system goes down during the downloading which takes one hour for a typic download. 
3. And an interrupted download must be restarted from the beginning. So during the download time, the system goes down means the user will waster at most one hour on downloading.
4. Therefore, rather then wasting one hour on restarted downloading from the beginning, wasting 1.5 minutes more on waiting system goes up again would be more acceptable.
